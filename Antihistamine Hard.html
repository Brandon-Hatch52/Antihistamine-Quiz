    },
    // 7 Allergic disease roles (urticaria vs anaphylaxis)
    {
      q: "Which scenario BEST illustrates histamine’s role in urticaria compared with anaphylaxis?",
      choices: [
        "Urticaria involves H2 receptors only, whereas anaphylaxis involves H1 only",

      q: "When comparing first- and second-generation H1 antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, which statement is MOST accurate?",
      choices: [
        "Second-generation agents are more sedating but less effective for allergy",
        "First-generation agents are less effective but have fewer side effects",
        "Both are effective for allergy, but second-generation agents cause much less sedation and fewer anticholinergic effects",
        "Only first-generation agents block H1 receptors"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation:
        "Both generations effectively treat allergic symptoms, but newer agents are designed to be less sedating and have fewer anticholinergic effects due to limited CNS penetration."

        "Cetirizine has slightly more CNS penetration than some other second-generation agents",
        "Loratadine is purely a topical nasal spray",
        "Cetirizine is primarily an H2 blocker"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation:
        "Cetirizine can cause mild drowsiness in some patients because it has slightly greater CNS penetration compared with loratadine or fexofenadine."
    },
    // 21 Fexofenadine & grapefruit juice
    {
      q: "A 40-year-old taking fexofenadine for chronic urticaria drinks large amounts of grapefruit juice daily. Why might this be a problem?",
      choices: [
        "Fexofenadine requires an acidic environment for absorption, which grapefruit juice eliminates",
        "Grapefruit juice inactivates a transport protein important for fexofenadine disposition, reducing effectiveness",
        "Grapefruit juice causes massive histamine release that overwhelms fexofenadine",
        "This combination precipitates immediate torsades de pointes"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation:
        "Grapefruit juice can inhibit transport proteins involved in fexofenadine’s metabolism/transport, so coadministration is discouraged due to reduced drug exposure and efficacy."

    // 22 Desloratadine vs loratadine (metabolite idea / indication)
    {
      q: "A patient well-controlled on loratadine is switched to desloratadine. Which statement is MOST accurate about this change?",
      choices: [
        "Desloratadine is a related newer-generation H1 blocker with similar indications for allergic rhinitis and urticaria",
        "Desloratadine is a first-generation agent and more sedating",
        "Desloratadine lacks H1 activity and works only on H2 receptors",
        "Desloratadine is used only for motion sickness"
      ],
      correct: 0,
      explanation:
        "Desloratadine is a newer-generation H1 antihistamine closely related to loratadine and used for similar allergic indications, with minimal sedation."
    },
    // 23 Meaning of "antihistamine" in practice
    {
      q: "In everyday clinical practice, what is MOST commonly meant by the term “antihistamine”?",
      choices: [
        "Any drug that affects histamine, including H1 and H2 blockers",
        "H1 receptor antagonists used for allergic conditions such as rhinitis and urticaria",
        "Only H2 blockers used for peptic ulcer disease",
        "Any drug ending in “-ine,” regardless of mechanism"
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation:
        "Although many drugs influence histamine, clinicians usually use “antihistamine” to mean H1 blockers used for allergy symptoms."
    },
    // 24 Confusion with -ine suffix
    {
      q: "A student assumes that all drugs ending in “-ine” are antihistamines. Which example BEST illustrates why this assumption is problematic?",
      choices: [
        "Loratadine is not an antihistamine",
        "Cimetidine is an antidepressant, not an antihistamine",
        "Dopamine is not an antihistamine despite the “-ine” suffix",
        "Fexofenadine is actually an H2 blocker"
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation:
        "Many medications (e.g., dopamine, clonidine) end in “-ine” but are not antihistamines, so relying on the suffix alone is misleading."
    },
    // 25 Azelastine nasal vs ophthalmic
    {
      q: "A patient with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis is prescribed azelastine ophthalmic drops and azelastine nasal spray. Which statement is MOST accurate?",
      choices: [
        "Both forms are selective peripheral H2 blockers",
        "The ophthalmic form acts locally as a peripheral H1 blocker and mast-cell stabilizer; the nasal form has both peripheral and some central activity",
        "Both formulations are systemic steroids",
        "The nasal form is purely a decongestant with no antihistamine effect"
      ],
